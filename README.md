# Connect 4 with Minimax Algorithms

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Connect 4 game, utilizing both the original Minimax algorithm and two parallel versions of it to optimize game performance. This repository is part of a research project presented as a thesis titled Implementation and Formal Verification of a Parallel Algorithm Based on Minmax using Concurrent Process Algebra and mCRL2.

## Description

Connect 4 is a classic game where two players take turns placing discs in a 6x7 vertical grid, trying to be the first to line up four of their discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project implements the game using a command line interface and allows players to compete against a computer-controlled opponent using the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves.

### Implemented Algorithms

- **Original Minimax**
- **Parallel Minimax v1**
- **Parallel Minimax v2**

## Features

- Fully functional Connect 4 game.
- Command line interface for easy interaction.
- AI opponent using Minimax algorithms.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyQT5 library.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

- **Command Line Version**: Run the file TerminalGame.py
- **GUI**: Run game_init.py
